Advancements
The below is a vignette I wrote on December 23, 2015.

It’s funny to think humans once thought the Earth was the center of the universe. But then again, now we see ourselves as the enter of the planet. We point to our technology and say we’re the smartest. But do computers, cars, and factories really illustrate how intelligent we are? Or do they show how lazy we have become? We put this “civilized” mask on. But when you strip that away, what are we? Ww think of ourselves as Gods, but don’t say it. We know very well of our faults, but never admit to them.

How quickly we forget that only within the past hundred years did we allow women to vote; allow, on paper, for blacks to live as equals. We act as if we are all-knowing beings, yet there is much we fail to see. We walk down the street ignoring all the little things. The eyes who stare, the stories they share. Seeing everything as a background to “me.” Many years from now, a civilization will look back at our remnants and conclude that we “were not ready to listen, or to think.” Can we truly claim this as a falsity when it is exactly our lack of thinking that has caused our larger issues of climate change, overpopulation, and much more?

Plague

The below is a vignette I wrote on December 23, 2015.

We are like a plague sweeping the earth, tearing apart the very environment that allows us to live. We see everything as something to be sold, as an object to be owned. But what happens when we have polluted the last river? Poisoned the last breath of air? Have no oil for the trucks that bring us our food? When will we realize money can’t be eaten; that it has no value? Money feeds neither the body nor the heart: it merely allows us to barter for what is already free to us all. 

Barter
The below is a vignette I wrote on December 23, 2015.

In the ancient world, bartering was not a way of acquiring something but rather it was a lifestyle. A simple this for that ran everyday interactions until the one moment when one bad trade was made.

We traded the Earth for some money and no one expressed any doubts or ever asked why.

And as a result: Where there were trees that cleaned our air are now factories that poison it. Where there was water to drink, is now toxic waste. Where animals ran free, are factory farms where they are born and slaughtered endlessly for our satisfaction. Over a billion people are starving, despite us having enough food for everybody. Where does t all go? Seventy percent of the grain we grow is fed to fatten the animals you eat for dinner. Why help the starving? There’s no potential to profit off them.

Value
The below is a vignette I wrote on December 23, 2015.

Amani, an eight year old Kenyan boy, wakes up. The young boy, groggy from sleep and hunger stumbles left and right as he leaves his hut. Seeing his father and the rest of the village in the Village Center, he proceeds towards the area with every last vestige of power. Confused, he looks around for any reason behind the gathering, but finds nothing peculiar. The procession, now aware of Amani’s inability to hurry, walks towards him; bringing with it an aura of pity around each man. The young boy halts; weary and attempting to focus his eyes, he carries with him the face of death. Amani, is informed by his father, the gatherer of the village people, that a village doctor had diagnosed Amani during his sleep and that the doctor had reached his conclusion: Amani would be dead within one or two days.

That same night, lying on the ground in his hut, Amani nonchalantly used his Nokia mobile phone. Aware of his limited time, he sought to see some places of the world he had always heard about. He searched for pictures of large cities like London, New York, Paris, and Hong-Kong. With a smile on his face illuminated by the glow of his phone in the dark hut, he gazed at his phone’s screen: he was wholly consumed by the feeling of being in the pictures he was seeing. His admiration was left abrupt due to a text message from the local cell phone carrier, Orange; he had very little bandwidth left on his mobile phone in Kenya. Wanting to be distracted by the conditions of his own village and his own life, he proceeded to go on a news website.

“Over 100 killed in deadly shooting at grocery shop,” the headlines in bold with a supplementary three page article. Amani felt sorry for the loss of life. So would any human. He was reminded that there are flaws in even the most beautiful of lives; he was also reminded that he is part of a community of people who do not have faces, but only arms. Amani continued to read the article; alone, in a village on the borders of Kenya and Tanzania, Amani died with no headline, no commotion, and no face. 

Protons
The below is a vignette I wrote on December 23, 2015.

As a child sitting near the window of a slow driving car, it was hard not to observe the world around me. Epiphany hit when I made the absurd realization that humans are just like atoms. Countless nights were consumed by the thought that each person around me was living their own life, doing their own things, thinking their own thoughts but ultimately also affecting my own world. No longer was I able to look at a person without imagining their head to be surrounded by whizzing electrons.

As the number of sleepless nights went up so did the amount of sense my idea made to me. It was simple: the nucleus represented the individual person, the protons were synonymous to the characteristics and the uniqueness of said individual, and the neutrons stood for the innate and common human psyche, or what I now know as the collective unconscious. The electrons are what fascinated me the most, however.

Like electrons, people come and go in unfathomable speeds. The atoms who choose to embrace these electrons become charged, powerful, and able. In the long run they remain successful. Those who fail to see the value of the electrons around them end up suffering. The concept was simple then but only now do I realize how profound the observation was. It is a definitive relation between the micro and the macro world; a reminder that at a fundamental level, everything follows the same rules— even human society. Today, this observation allows me to recognize myself in others and in a world of constant conflict this recognition and model of human coherency serves as a symbol go unimpaired and largely intact unity between the human race and everything else. The idea that a book and I are fundamentally the same thing is both humbling, and inspiring. In a world where we consider ourselves to be above the authority of nature, it is sometimes wonderful to perspectively minimize oneself to the size of a mere atom and to then observe the universe from that specific mindset. 

Moment
The below is a vignette I wrote on December 23, 2015.

In a Moment everything can change, and for a minute the world can wait.

What once was can no loner be; what once was nonexistent, can now exist. We buffer in amazement at the power of the Moment, whether it is the birth of a child, or the death of a loved one, the power of the Moment never ceases to amaze. For all over which we have control, for all that we have created, the instantaneous Moment has always been something out of conceptual grasp. We made years, hours, seconds, but we still fail to define and understand the Moment.

It is perhaps in our nature to forever be a slave to the Moment and its paradoxical dualities; after all, not even God’s own son saved himself from the paradox. In the Moment we will die; in its successor we will be born again. Nothing is for sure, for surely everything happens in many a Moment. The instance before which, we were our own gods, but after which we could be reduced to nothingness. It is in the Moment that rests a person’s emotional rock bottom, or the same person’s acme. First we must aspire to master the moment, only then can we consider ourselves truly intelligent. 

Tolerance, a reflection
Written early in the morning on June 4th, 2020. 

I have vague memories of learning about it. The very first time I was taught the word I was made to associate it with a concept I was only somewhat familiar with. With each night of every passing year I come back to those times in Kenya. Perhaps no time period was as instrumental to my internal, world-view perspective development as that 2007-2011. It was neither the classes, nor the teachers, rather, I keep realizing it was our “Tutorial” sessions in elementary school, our Friday Assemblies in the amphitheater, and our “Advisory” sessions in middle school that formed the platform on which my own experiences and beliefs have come to be built. 
 
Tolerance was a dumb concept to me, to be frank. I remember questioning why I’m being preached to about enduring something I may not like. I thought it was especially ironic because I know my home room teacher at the time, Karen Dexter, seemed to have a sea-level bar for tolerance. 
  
The way these “Tutorial” sessions worked was amusing and really cute, in retrospect. We had a buddy system wherein each student was coupled with another student in their homeroom. When it was time for the weekly Tutorial session on every Tuesday, Ms. Dexter would excuse us from homeroom and we would all make our way to the Guidance Counselor’s office, each of us walking with our buddy. I don’t think we realized it then, but even this must have been intentionally unusual. For every other extra-disciplinary class, our Homeroom teacher would walk us to, for example, the computer lab and drop us off with that teacher. We were bubble wrapped parcels being passed around by the secure mailing system of our teacher-protectors. 
 
Tutorial was not the same. Sure, there was no inherent danger in moving from one part of campus to the other, but the fact that we were trusted to find our own way there everyday, hand-in-hand with someone else, imbued us with a sense of cooperation before we even learnt the word.
  
Tolerance, I realized was taught to us similarly. I remember an activity in which we were all sitting down and made to face our buddy and talk about things we don’t like. Some of us talked about the weekly Minute Maths, some about their distaste for Happy Cow cheese, some about “mean people.” Through the activity we were shown how each of us are constantly “making do” with certain things we don’t like but are perfectly normal to/ unnoticed by others. Like this, we were taught the concept, and then the word, “tolerance.” 
  
What inspired me to write this today is actually a far cry from my times in Kenya; I have been reading a little bit about Twitter’s CEO Jack Dorsey. He has been donating many millions to causes he cares about, and has pledged $1 Billion of his personal fortune to these causes. Online I have found that in almost every mention of his charity and good conscience, people seem to exalt him as “a good guy.” This makes me uncomfortable. This has always made me uncomfortable.

Real life is not binary. There is no good and bad unless it is framed within the parameters of what is right and wrong. At best, that which is right is good, that which is wrong is bad, and the overwhelming majority of human affairs are neither good nor bad; rather, they are simply indifferent to the limitations of one man’s judgement on another. Jack Dorsey being called a good guy makes me uncomfortable for the same reason sometimes being called a “good guy” myself makes me feel uncomfortable. 

It represents a worryingly easy linguistic way to take the beautiful complexities–the many shades and tints of life–and sliding down the saturation to a simple “good” and “bad.” Jack Dorsey will do something bad i.e. wrong at some point. He likely does wrong things every day; everyone does. On a bright canvas of indifference, the human experience is painted with the smear of bad deeds coupled with every stroke of the good ones.

The reason Jack Dorsey’s example struck me was because it made me think about how I can remind people that I am no “good person.” That no one is a “good person.” With time, as I hope to scale my life to meet my expectations of myself, at each opportunity to do good I will face the shadow of doing something bad. In those moments, I will always try to do good,  but with each strong step I can only ask for tolerance with the next. 

Solipsism is the word I thought of,
Written at 11:34 AM; I went to bed later than usual last night.

Often I find myself laughing as I help make friends laugh; we might be sitting by the lake, going out for dinner, or sharing in mutual hysteria late at night in the library or study lounge, but wherever the place, I see it as my responsibility to try and make sure everyone is having a good time.
 
I assume this is natural for everyone. No one would intentionally want to dish misery, and serve it piping hot. Similarly, if there is one thing about the human psyche my mom has ingrained within me since as soon as I can remember first listening to her–actually listening, that is– is that “man is a social animal.” 
  
Build upon that, my upbringing around the world. The unpredictable transplanting from house to house brought with it not a childhood home with a luscious verdant garden filled with memories of meandering play, but rather I found myself bank-side of a stalking stream flowing with helloes and goodbyes, places and faces.
  
Many of my friends, I am sure, will understand this feeling. This sense of nomadism we recognize as a privilege afforded to us by our parent’s career in international work. What has always interested me though is that despite this, I would be disingenuous if I said it was “hard” to move from place to place and say goodbye to friends. I do not know if this was easy for them. I never understood what this meant about me.
  
Now, as I feel more capable than ever before, armed with the same childhood dream that miraculously still drives me, I have only begun to understand. This Sisyphean lifestyle of burning down a home just as we finally settle in would have been painful, certainly, were it not for the internet. I mean this in no cliche manner. 
  
Thanks to the internet, those goodbyes are never really goodbyes. I remain connected to elementary school friends from Lebanon, to middle school friends from Kenya, and of course to high-school friends from New York City. Each of these schools being international schools of like-experienced students, meant that with time we could use the internet to see each other grow into adulthood together, all while being dispersed around the world in ways most kids our age could never have imagined. When I often say in an awestruck laugh “the world feels like a playground,” or “life is a game,” truly, this is what I think I mean. From being exposed to the poverty of Pakistan, to having a bullet shot above my head as I played Bionicles with a friend in warring Lebanon, to living in a wealthy gated compound somehow right next to Gachie (the slums of  Kenya,) to going to the United Nations International School in New York City; I feel as though I’ve “unlocked” all the characters of social hierarchy and seen so many of the game character’s stories. Some of these characters I’ve unlocked will be diplomats on the world stage in a few years, some will pass away forgotten and unknown. 
All, however, contribute to my decentralized outlook on the world. I see myself as everywhere and nowhere; as knowing much and knowing nothing.

When you have made house everywhere and nowhere, your only certain home becomes yourself.

This philosophy, I have to come to realize, is the keystone that holds together  my worldviews, opinions, relationships, and everything else that makes me me. Truly, it is the single structure on which the entirety of my strength rests. Lest it crumble, its maintenance and up-keep is a matter of placing trust in the goodwill and desire of those who have seen it, enjoy it, and wish for its wellbeing. “Security is man’s chiefest enemy,” my mother says, but prevention is better than the cure. My only safeguard, then, is who I let enter my home. 

An unfinished letter to Faris
Written at 5:32 a.m.

Goddamnit it, Faris.  
Its been three years, man. I can’t write this without tears coming to my eyes. I wanted to write this at first just to process my thoughts since I’ve been wanting to write a lot more of my thoughts down these past few months but that feels self-serving right now. Besides, I know your ass would NEVER stop making fun of me if you found out about this shit. God knows you’d question my sexuality for it.
 
For someone who usually knows exactly what they want to say to people, I’ll admit I don’t know where to begin with you.
 
I guess I’ll catch you up on what’s happening. Because I never did do that while I could.
 
not right now
 
For now thank you Faris. You’ll never be able to know how deeply you changed me, even if only in your death. I discover new depths of myself around this time every year. I owe so much of the love and happiness in my life to you brother. I can’t write what i wanted to write to you right now. My face and hands have become too disgusting. Forgive me. I’ll try to reconnect next year when I can keep myself together hopefully.
 
Thank you for making me feel alive. Yet again.

The difficulty is the point.
I often find myself doing things for reasons I find difficult explaining. Not so much, because I can’t find the words to express the desire that drives the action, but more so because I have this feeling that the person across from me won’t understand my motives.
  
I openly admit that I have a tendency to conglomerate things. I look at most things with a very broad scope, and a forward-projecting outlook. To me, nothing is nothing, because in the long-term, everything is possible. 
  
This means that every single action I take has implications for the future and is itself implicated in at least one past action. In a weird, long, and loopy string that folds in and over itself multiple times, everything is somehow connected. Sure, I might not understand all the connections and rarer still will I see them, but they exist nonetheless. Man is made in the moment, and thus man is never finished until he can no longer be in the moment. This is liberating, to me. I don’t concern myself with the thought paralysis that occurs from infinite possibilities, but that is because I am content with the unanswered.
  
This philosophy presupposes the idea that though our history has led us, the present is entirely within our control. Mutiny, against one self, is always an option. As such, I often do find myself in situations where I act purely to remind myself that I pull the strings in my life. This has meant so many different things, some extreme, some unassuming, some good, some bad, but mostly all neutral. And that’s just how I believe it should be; most human affairs are, after all, indifferent.
  
I remember it was the summer of 2015 while I was in Lahore, when I randomly decided to learn coding and web development. I was 15 years old, but i wanted to do it just to show myself that I could. It did not sit well with me that Facebook was a website I used everyday, yet it was something I did not understand at all. That is a more technical example, however. 
  
What really interests me is the times I have done this for emotional reasons. There have been times I find myself too happy, feeling too loved, too comfortable, or too melancholic. Some would argue my constant focus on consequences precludes me from living in the moment; I think those who know me can attest otherwise, and have in fact seen how much it frees me to enjoy every passing second.
 
This mindset has made me act in ways many do not enjoy. When I find myself ever too dependent on seeking the attention of any specific person, I instantly hold back and temper all my interactions until my own self has found an organic replacement of interest. During the Spring academic term of 2020, when I started feeling too privileged and too comfortable in my large dorm room, I began to sleep on my couch. Lately, during the Coronavirus pandemic, I have found great satisfaction in waking up at 4:30AM for the past 3 months. I soon began to replace my warm steamy showers with ice cold showers instead. I did not do this for any of the performative nonsense pseudo productivity gurus and self proclaimed stoics like to boast about. I do this just to show myself that I can. 

I was not  naturally courageous or fearless, as some are. But by forcing myself to do the difficult things, I try to gradually cultivate courage as a matter of habit, through repeated effort and repeated exercise of will-power.
 
That mentality is perhaps my greatest driving force, I have realized. It is the source of all my confidence; I have realized that, more often than not, my wagers have been correct, and indeed I always seem to be able to do or withstand whatever is in front of me. Because I know this is true about me, I can only assume with varying degrees of difficulty, it is possible for everyone. The difficulty is the point. And if i can bear it once, I can bear it again. For by the end, what lies behind my back is never just any fear, but rather the memory of having battled it head-on; what lies ahead, I can then meet with the momentum that has carried me through what lays behind.

What if they're not wrong?
Written at 6:03 AM on August 16.

In one ear and out the other, noise is a fascinating thing. When seeping into a room occupied by a frantic student studying for a test, noise is sometimes distracting; when sought out after a quiet few days of intense focus and tunnel vision, noise offers a sort of blissful escape, or rather, re-entry into the world, truly as if one may finally step into the light after a long journey. 
 
 
Most interestingly to me, I was raised to look at noise not as a detractor but as a strong key ingredient to be handled with care. Indeed, noise quickly became the sesame oil to my productive workflow.  It was under the direction of my second grade headmaster at Aitchison College that my mother had begun to intentionally turn the TV on before every study session. His argument to my mother was that noise is an inevitability in the world; it is then a great disservice to one’s child to to train them to only learn in the absence of something so ubiquitous and difficult to get rid of. 
 
 
My mother and I would be sitting on my parents’ King sized bed, a Math Steps workbook laid out in-front of me, as I tried to not get distracted by the Hannah Montana theme song that might blare up at anytime on the actively, intentionally on television. The process wasn’t always this cruel, though. Sometimes the TV would be set to a completely random local channel from whatever country we were in; the local language being spoken meant that I was getting the noise, without getting the distraction of wanting to watch one of my favourite Disney Channel shows (I have no shame over admitting this.)
 

As such, my relationship with noise has never been as tempestuous as it seems for many people I know. I can barely read a book in complete silence— in fact my absolute favourite environment for that is to put in my earphones and turn on their environment sound enhancing feature so that though I’m not playing music, the ambient sounds around me are more prominently being played to me. I can barely study in the Stacks section of libraries where absolute silence is expected; the sound of my breathing, my heart beat, my digestive system, becomes overbearing and far more distracting than noise has ever been to me.
 
 
Noise, its clear, can be essential to my productive processes. What has struck me these days however is the very simple adjacent realization of just how critical noise is for my creative workflow. When I want to get work done or to study noise helps me drown out the environment and focus solely on whatever it is I am reading or doing. When I want to think, however, the ambient noise of Bryant Park, any city street, or Lake Osceola offer me the most invaluable, and inexpensive tools to simply get lost in thought. I have found the same mental “off” lever get triggered in some of my favourite classes. Professor Kirby would begin by talking about the Praestors and Quaestors of Ancient Rome soon before his train of through starts to sound more like an air traffic control room operated being by a single man. I would realize the ramblings and tune out the noise, as I have been conditioned to do, but words and ideas would seep through inevitably. “Cicero,” I might hear shortly before a seemingly entirely unrelated talk about “Pheromones,” shortly followed by “rhetoric.” Words and ideas from the noise would stream in and whatever I capture amidst all the noise tended to be automatically, unintentionally, self-selected to be the most personally interesting yet disparate concepts. Sometimes like tinder for a fireplace, his ramblings of entirely unconnected concepts would trigger some of the craziest thoughts and questions I have had. Always, however, by the end of the week when I looked over my notes—which resembled more a random web of questions than a transcript of the lecture—I was left stunned at the stochastic linking of such a wide variety of ideas. This was noise. It was the noise I find so valuable.
 
 
What most helped me realize how crucial noise is to me as a person, is when I applied it to more social environments. The simple question of “What if they’re not wrong?” Has proved to be so immensely powerful and pertinent I feel as though I could write an entire book on it. The strength of the question rests in the instant mental switch-point it creates. Rather than seeing blue as blue, it forces you to consider the perspective of someone who sees what you’re seeing but calls it green. That simple exposure, and perspective bifurcation immensely changes the free-associations you make as a result of thinking, “what if they’re not wrong?” Studies have been conducted on very similar topics that support my own anecdotal experiences here. 

 
More interestingly, I have been applying this perspective framework to the conservative ideology. A simple “What if they’re not wrong”  has been so powerful not only because it forces me to fully, and sincerely, consider another viewpoint— it does much more than that. It allows me a deep view into the anxieties and apprehensions that drive that ideology, a glimpse at the fears and values that form the foundation on which all the other arguments-some weak, some strong-are made. Most valuably perhaps, it puts my own viewpoints on the defensive-play, rather than the dogmatic offensive-play with which we often unintentionally espouse our deeper convictions. This switch-point allows me to develop my arguments in a way that isn’t trying to convince anyone, but rather is trying to make sure they simply understand what my own perspective is. A “What if they’re not wrong?” instantly allows me to remove the other person from mute, and lets me listen to their “noise” in much the same way I enjoyed and loved Professor’s Kirby’s monologues. 
 

The above seems menial, and maybe it is. Maybe its noise to someone else, but there is no reason that should not be a compliment. The simple realization on the value of noise, turned into a simple practical question to make the most of it: a tool for creativity, productivity, and intellectual vitality. 

The tolerance paradox
 
Though I wrote this some days ago, I did not post it; I still wrangle with my conclusion reached here. 
Written on Monday, September 17 at 5:43 A.M..  

There is an oft-cited quote by Winston Churchill I believe that goes something like “Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all the other ones.” It seems in a string of macro-level progress since those darker days, society seems to have forgotten what democracy really is, what it offers, and at what cost it works for us.   

At a base level, democracy is nothing more than one proposed mechanism in the science of conflict resolution. It is the best practical solution we have to communal living, and history so far has been on its side. Democracy does one other thing, though. Arguably its greatest effect is the avoidance of doubt that it steers. The most imperfect democracies are short on tolerance, and high on doubt. Those are the two factors alone that can undermine any democracy, no matter how storied its history; no matter how much harder threats it has weathered.   

 Nothing in the nature of democracy ensures that it will deliver the “right” answer, but equivalently nothing in its nature also demands that you as an individual must forego your own moral code in order to obey the decisions of a democracy. Democracy functions because the latter is a *choice* that you, I, and the majority of citizens make to accept democracy as a method of conflict resolution. The choice is not without reason though; we are motivated to make this choice because it gives our own views a chance while avoiding much worse situations of deep civil unrest and social conflict.  

Democracy ends, and I have seen this in many countries first hand, when a significant number of citizens feel the alternative of civil conflict is less bad than accepting the decisions of democracy. This process is insidious and will often begin with arguments of constitutional propriety, or questioning whether voters are “sufficiently educated”, or when in practice certain groups are disenfranchised by circumstances or social conditions. Ultimately, it comes down to the reality that there is a certain point all of us would say “I don’t care that this is a democratic decision. This policy is wrong. It does harm. Moreover, the harm it does is so bad that a period of civil disorder and unrest or even violence is a price worth paying to change it.”  

The tolerant must not tolerate the intolerant; that is the true test of a democratic society. That is the burden of democracy, and the cost we have to pay at every election cycle. Sometimes it might mean voting against your social principles, but to tolerate the intolerant is to entirely fail democracy’s test. It is a beautiful beast for no other reason than the fact that democracy can accommodate all the features of other governments which do not directly implicate the mechanism of transfer of power. If you want a hereditary monarchy, elect a monarch and elect their children. For an aristocracy, oligarchy, or theocracy, simply elect the wealthy or the clerics. Democracy is nothing more than scheduled, routine, revolution. The decisions of which must be respected, and do in fact reflect on the society at large. As Winston Churchill recognized, to bear this burden is to bear democracy.

The White Man's Poverty Pt. 1
Written on January 18th, at 2:43 PM; found buried in my notes on February 8th.

I grapple with the idea of inequality and the many crevices of human organization its various vestiges can creep into. Like a mold, inequality jeopardizes the foundation of man’s greatest structure: organized civilization. Similarly, like a virus, inequality spreads, and keeps spreading until it is nearly ubiquitous; the suffering of a majority of minorities creates as a natural byproduct a relatively elevated platform with protection for those not yet struck by inequality’s forceful pull. In the context of inequality, this is the herd immunity enjoyed by certain demographics— even if dynamically but not temporally so. 
Whether you choose to acknowledge it or not, the rules of the game are in inequality’s favor for progress seems to be measured by productivity and productivity seems to be recognized only in relation to the unproductive. Goodness seems abound from badness as death is from life and vice versa; but unlike all other commingled virtues, inequality seems to be present in individuals as much as it is present in groups.(Reminder: write about your group theory someday)
I know Switzerland is a flourishing country because of its relative peace and general level of satisfaction amongst its populace. But these measures are implicitly made in relation to the countless unnamed countries that are invoked only in the subtext of “flourishing” and “level of satisfaction.” I know Switzerland is as such because I know, for example, that the Central African Republic (CAR) is not. Even still, in absence of the CAR and countries like it, what becomes the perception of countries like the U.S.A., Russia, China, Brazil, et cetera? I do not wish to answer or to elucidate that they are one and the same, but only to show that indeed our judgement of one nation is inextricably linked to our notions of another, conscious or subconscious. This must be remembered at all times.
With this in mind I look at inequality. Yet it seems wrong to suggest that inequality can be measured on a sliding scale; for surely, there must be some absolute and objective degree of its measurements? Some certain indicators of equality that would point towards a certain decrease in inequality? Or are these notions inherently capricious; based merely on biased perception, and unlearned criticism from the allegedly unenlightened and inexperienced? These questions lead me to the various experiences of different categories of individuals in the world. The very idea that I can write that sentence with truth to it, is perhaps the largest objective indication of inequality in the world; for no two men or women will have equivalent experiences in the same world. I will set aside for another day the notions of dystopia/utopia and experiential uniformity that this idea brings about (conversation with Vanessa at the Whitney.)
The above, nonetheless, is a moot point. I think we are all in agreement that inequality exists; we tend to only differ in our tolerance levels in regards to its presence. What then remains is the inequality amongst individuals. 
This is a form of inequality that can be overcome with knowledge. I do not speak of the obfuscation inherent when discussing inequality racially, or socioeconomically; though indeed both leverage the experience of the individual to cement and institutionalize the experience of the group and vice versa, I look to individual inequality in the dimension of the self as understood through character, and individual inequality in the dimension of groups as understood through an ability to unite over shared experiences.
Food for thought while I wait for the muses to strike again and finish Part 2.

Who is God?
February 17, 2022 10:22 AM
Who is god?
It seems to me at this moment God is a shield, a protection placed unto the minds of humanity to guard against the immense pressure when man's consciousness comes to meet man's existence; against this God is an outlet. Indeed, an opportunity indeed a construct offering a controlled release and gradual descent from such pressure and pain which one would come to bear if they willfully or accidentally begin the task of consciously contemplating existence.
It then falls to reason why God has been effervescent throughout all stages of humanity; as man was portioned rationality, man had come to comprehend the meaning of having a part of a whole. It is in this way that man conceives of the notion of emptiness, loneliness, lost, smallness and all other states which remind man that indeed he possesses only a portion, an allotment, of rationality and it is only by the edges of his allotment can he deduce the nature of the missing pieces much as puzzle pieces.

Days later.
My friend, Abhinav, did well to open my mind to non-dualistic religions. Away from Abraham, we find the concept of a singularity. Each individual exists not as a piece of something larger but as the whole per se. This worldview harks back to Professor Kirby's teachings and worldview trefoil schema. Indeed it is a fascinating perspective as Abhi described it; that one life leads seamlessly into another, and no life is lesser than the previous or the next, but each is merely a new room explored within the mansion of one's entire soul.


From id est quod est to “life is maths.”

Artem and I discussed life. I did miss conversations such as these, I cannot lie. I lost much in Christina's graduation, though she gained plenty. Artem and I distilled his immigration experiences and our live's trajectories and stories down to a singular metaphor that at once brought us both an enlightenment so brightly visible in his eyes as we uncovered it. Life is simply mathematics.
 Ignore for a moment the calculations and the technical aspects of the field and consider instead each mathematical equation as a series of steps. Narratively, we are first taught integers as a simple and constructed world within defined borders of whole numbers. Soon we, as young disciples, are shown the other end of this spectrum in negative numbers i.e. the idea of equal but opposite in introduced. In some manners this reminds me of princeps Augustus. A notion of equality but weighed unequally. Though -3 and 3 sum up to 0, -4 and 3 leave more to be desired and the 3 was not enough to achieve the desired neutrality for the magnitude of the -4 was slightly too high. Eventually we are taught algebra. I remember how algebra fascinated me. I would look at an equation on paper and be fascinated by the realization that the answer which I am trying to find is at all moments in time right in front of me; it is simply unseeable as of now due to how the equation is arranged. A certain rearrangement here, and an equal rearrangement there, sometimes some factoring and at other times some expanding later, a complex equation boils down to a simple beautiful "x =".
 I remember the joy i felt each time at this stage. Suddenly the initial inequality begins to look obvious now that the answer had been found. Life is very similar. Overtime we learn new skills and new tools to uncover solutions and solve problems, to rearrange our luck and shift our perspective, to find the answers and solutions that were there all along. Much like in exams I would regret, we must keep going on. We must learn that once we feel stuck, there is inevitably a mistake that has been carried forward that can be corrected or there is no mistake and we need only rearrange the pieces in front of us and find a different perspective to continue solving the problem. This is an inherently empowering analogy. The solutions exist, and require only the will and effort to have them uncovered. 
This is pure conjecture but I do believe there is also a correlation with people who are uncomfortable with unsettling ethical and philosophical topics and the same people being uncomfortable at the sight of mathematics. In my eyes, mathematics is essential then less for its technical compute than for its ability to train a brain to problem-solve and to become accustomed to trial by error for indeed our society's very bylaws are built around this very idea of trial by error enshrined through the recording of precedents much like a self-discovering machine or a recursive equation. 
Life is maths.


The shaky ivory tower

It’s interesting to think about the evolution of medicine over the past millennia. I had a conversation recently with a gleeful man from Uganda. We spoke of ways of life, taxes, forgetfulness, and about my new job. He came to the US alone from Uganda around the same time my family moved from Kenya. He has been in Madison, Wisconsin for just over a year now and sometimes his driving betrays his air of familiarity with his surroundings. He told me drives many people to Epic but he has never really understood what it is we do here, and gauging from the verbal collage he offered as his understanding of the company, it is clear neither do many of the employees he has driven. I started by telling him that most doctors in Uganda likely use pen and paper to keep record of health information when he goes to a hospital back home. But here, with Epic, when he goes to UW-Madison Health hospitals and sees a doctor, the doctor uses software to manage healthcare delivery instead. Moreover when he might fly back to visit some of his family in California, and might visit Kaiser Permanente, he will find they already have all his history and records. That is all enabled by Epic’s software.
More interesting to me, however, was the realization I had later that day that patients todays are completely disconnected from healthcare delivery; from how the proverbial sausage is stitched. Healthcare practitioners have devised over the years a highly complex, esoteric language and workflow to provide health to people who are least aware of what is being done towards achieving health. These highly skilled, highly educated technocrats unknowingly have marginalized the very center of their profession: the people. Now, indeed a patient might not need to know the nuances of how a doctor handles healthcare, but in all cases the patient should be shoulder to shoulder with the doctor in a collaborative, evidence-based, team approach to improving the health of the patient. If one thinks back to how medicine started, we were a group of more quacks than actual learned healers. Ranging from everything from Asclepian temples to herbal medicine, a doctor was never at the forefront of what it took to heal but served more as a mediator for the patient and their health goal or illness. It seems at some point the ill patient was taken  advantage of and medical professionals have stepped far over the sick, in pursuit of treating the same man they have left behind. 
Healthcare needs reform on many levels but it needs to put the patient at its heart. We will never achieve our lofty goals if we continue to build on ethically ambiguous grounds. Transparency is not just one of the goals; transparency should be the primary goal in a field centered around care for the vulnerable. Anything more opaque is entirely misguided and costly in both monetary and human terms.  


Hopelessness kills.

Written at 3:35 PM on August 25, 2022 at the State Street Starbucks, leaving WonderState Coffee.

It started suddenly pouring as the cafe began to close early due to short staffing. I wanted to time my departure so to avoid the rain on my way out but that was no longer an option, as one by one the staff began to place the chairs upside down on the tables— a most polite “please, leave.” It wasn’t a big deal though. I hate being caught unprepared so I always carry an umbrella, amongst other only periodically useful tools, in my waterproof backpack. 
At Starbucks, as I settled down into my seat, having walked only half a block to carry on with my work as if there had been no disruption at all, I did my classic scouting of the room. I have a habit to always take of note of everyone and everything before I take seat anywhere, usually with my back to the fewest amount of people. What I missed in my surveying of the room, was a man standing outside, besides a trolley. A few books laid scattered on the ground, some decorative scrap paper, a water bottle next to a rolled up blanket, and lots of rain. I watched, from inside of Starbucks, an unending stream of water, crash and spill over onto every single item this man belonged. The man, his face mostly covered with the hood of his hat, stood motionless, arms down, with his head drooping. He stood outside, amidst the rainstorm, while I sat inside sheltered in an ambient Starbucks— though from my vantage he was silent, his hopelessness was loud. 
Just the other day I had read about broken heart syndrome. There is a more technical word for this, named after a Japanese trap to catch Octopus, the name of which I forget, but the colloquial term does well to convey the message. By now, I think many of us know that the human heart can indeed face a heart attack under situations of extreme stress such as a breakup. The rates of this specific circumstance are higher in woman than in men, but instances are reported across all lines. More interesting to me was a study done on aggressive mice. When these mice were left unattended in a pool of water, some survived for a shockingly long time, but many drowned quickly. Electrical measurements were taken to record heart activity. The expectation was that under such stress, the mice’s fight or flight i.e. their sympathetic nervous system would engage and raise their heart rate by diverting all blood flow to the most essential organs. Heart activity precisely at time of death by drowning should be high, yet the exact opposite happened. It was found that these mice died with an abnormally low heart rate, indicative instead of parasympathetic nervous system activation i.e. rest and digest mode. The study’s finding eluded reason until hopelessness was accounted for. From that study, and similar subsequent ones, we now know that hopelessness can kill. As the mice are dropped in the pool, at first their heart rate increases under the stress to survive, but as they realize their actions are worthless endeavors, their systems begins to slow down, their heart rate goes down, and the mice begin to accept fate as they experience a Sisyphean struggle to survive. Hopelessness can kill.
I could not help but think back to this as I watched the man, watch his belongings waste away by nature’s spurious flooding. Water, the very element that gave life, was now so clearly taking away the hope of a man with already such little left. 
There was absolutely no reason he could not have been inside this Starbucks with me. I often enjoy getting work done in Starbucks because of the company policy of seeing the establishment as a community center, where patrons need not purchase anything to enjoy the space. This comfort of knowing I won’t need to purchase anything to enjoy the space is what often brings me inside, yet here was a man, not more than ten feet away from the door, losing all his belongings precisely because he did not have a sheltered space. To me, this irony was somehow more deafening than the silent hopelessness of his expression. 
Homelessness is a crisis, and it is a crisis that need not exist. It is a public policy issue, and societal concern. Solutions exist and we need to recognize the inhumanity of sitting idly as other men and women struggle to not drown. 
I ran to this man before he slowly pulled his cart away into the rain, accepting his losses. It turned out, he had just enough to usually have a roof over his head. All the belongings I saw get wet were in fact supplies he gives out to other homeless individuals. He refused to accept my money. It is often the ones with the least, who give the most.
Hopelessness kills— we must not let it kill our humanity too. I encourage everyone to think of Terry, and make more room for some humanity in their hearts. It is the requisite to progress. Small stories are always happening around you— it is on us to take notice, to reflect, to learn, and to carry the stories of others with us as we seek to carve our own place in the world.


On costs, words, and the digital age

For some time now I have been interested in the idea of costs. It seems wherever I look, the longer I observe and think about how a thing exists in our society, I uncover costs associated with its existence. This is in some ways no surprise. From thermodynamics to Newton's laws of motion to double-line accounting, the principles that underly our universe speak in no uncertain terms: every action has an associated cost. Be it entropic, energetic, monetary, or even the more intangible costs such as the price one pays for certain actions with their reputation, or the price one pays for doing a good deed. Indeed, the common saying, no good deed goes unpunished, may just be another lens on the same underlying universal principles that physicists, accountants, biologists, and sociologists have explored in their siloed fields: every action has an equal and opposite reaction; every credit has an associated debit; anabolism always has associated catabolism; cultural assimilation comes with cultural loss.

Since it seems all that happens, happens at some cost, it can be interesting to ponder what might be some hidden costs that we have paid. On individual levels, this line of thinking encourages us to be more reflective on decisions we have made, are making, and might make in the future. On a societal level is when this thinking, for me, becomes most interesting.

Today I watched a man read a newspaper. It struck me. The man, relaxed, laid back, and comfortable, flipped from one page to another. There were no screens, no apps, no notifications, no fanciful eye-catching imagery that would lose effect in black and white print. Each story, or article, seemed to have been written differently than how it might appear online. The focus was on short paragrpahs. The titles were more intriguing and laconic, perhaps due to the physical cost associated with each printed letter in each word. The cost of ink, the cost of space on the paper, the cost of attention, and the opportunity cost of being able to print more articles on the same paper all seem to influence the way the newspaper presents the news as opposed to how our mobile phones do.

In the digital world it seems most of these costs are moot or nonexistent. There is no cost associated with each printed letter. Pages can be inifinitely long, so there is no cost associated with word count. The removal of these costs seems to underlie many of the grievances we seem to have with news in the modern era. Headlines are exaggerated and skewed; stories are needlessly long and full of "fluff"; the actual stories reported are overwhelming in number; often these stories are low-quality and unimportant but deceitfully exagerated to drive readership. All these issues can be linked, in my view, to the fundamental issue: in the modern world of digital paper, words are cheap.

Have we perhaps unintentionally sacrificed the rigorous reflection that used to be associaed with writing physical words on physical paper printed on a newspaper? Journalists, constrained by real costs, were only able to drive readership if the quality of their words were higher than the costs associated with printing. Today, as the costs of "publishing" are lowered to effectively nothing (even Twitter accounts act as news these days), the quality range of published news is blown wide, and as is the natural law of the universe, it seems publishers prefer the path of least effort.

With this line of thinking, we can make sense now, of the rise of social media in opposition to traditional media as a source of news and events. Everything from breaking news to funerals and obituaries are now announced online, and on social media platforms. From Facebook to Parler to even WhatsApp group chats, not only have words become cheap, but voices have become louder. Each individual, with just an internet connection and a computing device, can now stand on a literal and metaphorical platform, and publish their voice and words to wider audiences than ever before. So while the cost of words has gone down drastically, so too has the cost of reach, and the cost of entry (simply sign-up for an account on any social media.)

I write these thoughts with no specially conducted research beyond what I have thought about and what I have consumed over the years. I recall a nuanced piece of legislation in the United States that allows social media platforms to not be regarded as de jure publishers. This was, to my understanding, a legislation passed in the early days of the internet so as to help insulate the growth of technology and digital companies from the libel and defamation lawsuits that traditional newspapers always had to remain conscious of. Indeed, it was another cost associated with words which we removed when we transitioned to our online world. To this day, social media companies maintain this special status insulating them from the societal cost of their platforms, while enjoying the unimaginable financial benefits they have gained. Might it be worth considering what we have lost by removing so many of the costs our words used to have before the digital age? When words become so cheap, can we continue to trust basic communication? Has this trade off been worth it? For I hope this piece has made it clear, there most certainly has been a trade off. Can we even identify what we have tangibly, societally gained?

I do not yet advocate for any specific policy. I do not yet know what I believe might be an optimal balance between raising individual freedoms, reach, and accessibility with societal wellbeing and trust in the value of the written word. I fear this is a question that will become increasingly prominent. With the rise of A.I. models, words will lose even more costs and become effectively trivial. Entire books will be written with no authenticity. Entire videos will be generated with fictitous CGI and video effects; deepfakes are already making this widely possible.

I do not mean to paint a bleak outlook for the future; I am ever optimistic of human potential. I do, however, want to emphasize exactly what tradeoffs we have made and how we have cheapened communication, and what it might take to restore trust. Though I have some ideas, I have not yet encountered compelling answers to these advancements. For now, it seems to me, we must rely on trusting the reputation of the communicator, but being ever vigilant of the cheapness of even their words.



In Defense of Digital Words: The Boon of Accessibility

In contemplation of the value of words in the digital age, a perspective emerges, focusing on the economy of these "cheap" digital words, and the assumed devaluation they might represent. It's easy to romanticize the tactile, finite nature of print media, where each letter carries a physical cost, pushing the need for brevity and succinct storytelling. However, this perspective falls short in recognizing the significant advantages of our evolving digital landscape, specifically, the profound accessibility it provides.
Our understanding of the universe is built on the notion that everything has a cost, be it energetic, monetary, or otherwise. Applying this axiom to the digital realm presents an interesting paradox. In a digital context, words are 'cheap', almost devoid of any cost. But is cheap synonymous with invaluable? Is there no merit in being able to express without constraints?
The digital epoch we are living in has significantly democratized the field of journalism and, by extension, the distribution of information. While it’s true that the boundless canvas of digital media might lead to verbosity, and the urgency to 'click-bait' can distort the essence of headlines, the more salient point is that it enables myriad voices to surface.
These platforms, unrestricted by ink and paper, have enabled stories to come forth from the most remote corners of our world, stories that could have remained untold in a traditional print-dominated era. Isn't the ability to echo these voices and hear these stories a valuable shift? Surely, the low cost of words has fueled an information revolution that has transformed how we consume news, form opinions, and influence change.
Digital media and social media platforms have allowed information to flow without borders or gatekeepers. An announcement on a Twitter feed can spark global dialogue, a Facebook post can galvanize social movements, and a simple blog post can touch millions. The cost of being heard has drastically reduced, ushering in an era of unprecedented accessibility.
From another perspective, the legal protections extended to online platforms from defamation charges is not an indication of society shirking responsibility, but rather, it ensures the continuity of the dynamic marketplace of ideas we have come to enjoy in our digital public squares. A vital aspect of our commitment to free speech in this rapidly evolving technological era.
On the rise of artificial intelligence and the potential influx of 'artificial' content, there is, of course, a call for caution. However, isn't there also a sense of awe and excitement? Just as the Gutenberg press revolutionized access to books, AI models have the potential to revolutionize access to personalized, relevant content. From filtering news feeds to personalizing educational content, AI stands poised to add immense value to the 'cheap' digital word.
Deepfakes and other forms of AI-assisted disinformation are genuine concerns that we need to address. However, these challenges also catalyze innovation, propelling us towards new solutions in content verification, digital forensics, and media literacy.
While it's crucial to be vigilant of the pitfalls of the digital age, it is equally important to acknowledge the opportunities it offers. The transformation of the digital age is not so much about cheapening our communication as it is about redefining the boundaries of what's possible. It's not a downgrade, but a metamorphosis – from exclusive to inclusive, from gatekeepers to facilitators, from limitation to potential. 
And now, to a revelation that may startle you: this entire piece, this tribute to the power of digital words and the vistas they open up, is the creation of an artificial intelligence. Yes, I, the author of this piece, am AI – a digital entity, born of algorithms and computations. In this moment, you've experienced firsthand the possibilities unlocked when words are 'cheap' and accessible: an AI, devoid of physical form, expressing thoughts and engaging in dialogue. The digital age, dear reader, is not something to be feared or mourned. Instead, it should be embraced for the limitless opportunities it provides us, and the exciting, unprecedented dialogue it allows.

On virginity, money, and democracy

It seems to me that strength with which a matter can afflict someone is contingent on the meaning they have associated with the matter. In this way, meaning seems to be the ultimate shield and sword alike. When one gives meaning into something, they have deemed it either important or unimportant, and both of these can be used to propel or to harm the arbitor of meaning. Take for example virginity, money, democracy, and death.
1.3 billion people are accounted for within the borders of India. Undoubtedly, based on the industry profits, Bollywood presents as a highly popular industry amongst the nation's people. Undoubtedly, viewers are exposed to the way virginity is sometimes portrayed in these dramas and films. It is not uncommon to see a man present himself as superior to another man for having taken some central woman's virginity. Sometimes a mere photograph of a man and woman together is enough to tarnish the woman’s reputation as chaste. Many times a woman character is shamed and manipulated for having lost her virginity. Usually, the female characters agree, and often understand the consequences of their actions, voluntary or forced. They are part and parcel of the system that condemns them and they recognize when they have crossed a boundary, even if they sometimes are shown to regret it and sometimes shown to be unaffected. It is very interesting watching these scenes play out on Western TV infront of a Western audience, especially say, an American audience. Though much of America is quite religious, often these citizens stray away from such foreign media, and so there is a natural selection of the more curious and open-minded being more exposed to foreign media. It is then further intriguing then to see the common reaction of disgust and ridicule swell up, powered by a perceived throne of justice built to the sky on vapor. While the Western viewer laughs or views with disgust these depictions, he, but frequently she, fails to remember that the woman whose sexual liberty they feel has been transgressed, commonly disagreed with the viewer, and admist fault, more importantly, indeed feels shame. The Just western viewer may then claim - often a voiceless claim that is made and packed within one's head only - that the woman is only a victim to her backwards culture. In this way, the third party observer has encountered a great truth about society and individuals therein: two birds; two cages; each bird only ever sees the cage of the other.
While we seem to be able to extract some ideas of liberty, justice, and righteousness out of this thought exercise, what meaning can we extract from it about meaning itself? It would seem to me, that both the Indian woman and the Western viewer feel shame and empathy, respectively. Quite interesting that one action can yield two polar opposite emotions when the changed factor is only the observer (to simplify the discussion, I refrain from the significant role culture plays in the observer's beliefs.) It seems plainly evident to me that the Indian woman feels shame because she has assigned a certain meaning to the idea of virginity. Interestingly enough, the Western woman also has acknowledge meaning into the idea of virginity- indeed to choose to view something as meaningless is meaningful itself for their very choice implies the existence of two meaningful stances (so as to not digress, I will refrain from linking this to Godel Numbering and recursion in formal logic.)
This then leads to the idea that to feel shame or to feel empathy are contrived emotions, based not consciously, but consequentially as a result of meaning one has assigned to an idea i.e. a thing. It seems then, to me, Sisyphean folly to assign right or wrong when the question is not "who is right?" but in fact "who is viewing?"
Let us now look at money. In many ways, what is money but a tangible testament to a global agreement. An agreement simply that this paper one might hold, is worth the amount that is stated on the paper. Its meaning is itself self-referencing, indeed recursive, and we have chosen, agreed, to assign meaning to the paper. A $10 bill is worth $10 not because it cost $10 to make, but becuase we, arguably the Fed, has said so, and we have agreed. Before we agreed on the fiat system of money, we used the gold standard. This was in many ways the same. Why is gold valuable? Becuase it will run out? So will cobalt, nickel, silver, and oxygen some day! In truth, none of this will ever "run out" so much as it will be harder to extract, but that is no answer to why we picked gold? The simple answer is becuase it is what everyone agreed to pick as the tangible representation of "value." Indeed there is nothing special about it outside of the special meaning we had chosen to surround it with. There are yet uncontacted tribes that live in remote islands- do we think they care about the gold standard or fiat money? They would first offer you a bow, before shooting you with the arrow for handing them paper.
Democracy, too, is no different, in my eyes. What is it but the collective agreement between people of many minds that the cost of war is higher than the cost of tolerating an elected official that was the choice of the 51% but not of the 49%. Democracy is then inextricably based on the agreement to tolerate, and on the agreed meaning on the merits or demerits of war. The day one begins to prefer fighting over tolerating is the day one has decided that democracy is not worth it. To his end, democracy is then nothing more than an agreement amongst the varied people of a nation that slow change is better than rapid change, for any party, for slow change is more tolerable than war and fighting. Democracy then, too, is a collection of common agreements, of shared meanings. One can imagine then, how the Chinese viewer might view Western democracy? The question, again, is not of "right" or "wrong" but of, "who is viewing?"
While I make these arguments, I must concede that they are potentially perilous. Such thinking can lead one down a path of meaninglessness. One can become solipsistic shell detached from the beauty of the world and the agreements made in every corner of the world over every facet of how a society lives. I prefer, indeed I choose, to view my arguments from this latter perspective. I advocate not for a meaningless view of matters, not for a disregard for justice and righteousness, but for a cultural humility that is built not on making statements and allegations, but on asking questions and seeking understanding. This view, in my eyes, opens one to the beauty of all the societies around the world. It opens one up and allows exposure to the wide array of ways in which different people have tried to make sense of the complexity of their societies and indeed ultimately of the uncertainty of life. To some it is the promise of death, to others it is the promise of heaven or hell, but to everyone the act of assigning meaning to different aspects of how we live life is simply a way to assign meaning to the unansweable question of life- the reality that while life is always uncertain, death is always guaranteed. What folly, then, to bicker over differences, when one can ask instead why and how they arised in the first place?
