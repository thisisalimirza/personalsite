                    <p>You do not fear making a decision, but you often fear being misunderstood in your process. In those moments you are foolishly being subservient to those looking for someone to follow. Lead the way until you do not need to.</p>

                    <p>When provoked, remember that your reaction alone dictates whether the provocation becomes a talking point afterwards. Look at provocation as bait, recognize it, but do not be pulled by it.</p>

                    <p>Like in a stream of water shooting out of a fountain: when the droplets are few and spaced their motion seems rapid and energetic, but at the very stem of the stream where the droplets are many and clustered the motion seems slow even if coordinated. There is a balance to be found between organization in numbers and efficiency. Naturally, in a fountain stream it is at the maxima.</p>
