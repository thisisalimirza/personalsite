        <p>I have been thinking about poverty a lot lately. Not in the way that I usually do, where I think about the poverty I have seen in Pakistan, or in Kenya, or in any of the other places I have been fortunate enough to visit.

I have been seeing it in the faces of the people who work at the grocery store, and in the faces of the people who work at the gas station, and in the faces of the people who work at the fast food restaurants. I have been seeing it in the faces of the people who live in the trailer parks, and in the faces of the people who live in the run-down apartments, and in the faces of the people who live in the houses that are falling apart.</p>
