        <p>In the age of digital communication, words have become both more abundant and, paradoxically, more precious. The cost of producing and distributing words has dropped to nearly zero, yet the value of meaningful communication seems to have increased. This paradox lies at the heart of our modern relationship with language.</p>

        <p>When I was younger, writing was a physical act. Each word had a tangible cost - in paper, in ink, in the effort of handwriting or typing. These physical constraints naturally led to more careful consideration of what was worth writing. The act of writing itself was a filter, ensuring that only thoughts deemed truly worthy made it onto the page.</p>

        <p>Now, we live in an age where the marginal cost of an additional word is effectively zero. Social media platforms, blogs, messaging apps - they've all made it possible to broadcast our thoughts instantly and endlessly. This has led to an explosion of written content, but has it led to better communication?</p>

        <p>The removal of physical constraints has revealed something interesting: the true cost of words was never in their production or distribution. The real cost lies in the cognitive burden they place on both writer and reader. Every word we write asks for someone's attention, and attention remains a finite resource even in an infinite digital space.</p>

        <p>This realization has profound implications. When writing was expensive, the physical costs acted as a natural filter for quality. Now that writing is essentially free, we need to be more conscious than ever about the attention costs we impose on others. The responsibility has shifted from external constraints to internal discipline.</p>

        <p>Yet there's another dimension to consider. The digital age hasn't just changed how we write; it's changed how we read. We skim more than we read, scan more than we absorb. Our reading habits have adapted to cope with the sheer volume of words we encounter daily. This, in turn, influences how we write - shorter paragraphs, more frequent breaks, clearer structure.</p>

        <p>The challenge, then, is to find a balance. How do we maintain the depth and thoughtfulness that physical constraints once encouraged while taking advantage of the freedom and reach that digital platforms provide? How do we ensure our words carry weight in a world where words are weightless?</p>

        <p>Perhaps the answer lies in reimagining what we mean by "cost." Instead of measuring the cost of words in paper and ink, we should measure it in impact and meaning. A well-crafted message that resonates with its audience is worth more than a thousand thoughtless posts, regardless of how easy it was to produce.</p>

        <p>This new economy of words demands a different kind of literacy. We need to be skilled not just in producing words, but in producing words that matter. We need to understand that while the tools of communication have become simpler, the art of communication remains as complex as ever.</p>

        <p>The digital age hasn't made words cheaper - it's just changed the currency in which we measure their worth. The cost is no longer monetary or physical; it's measured in the increasingly precious commodity of human attention. And that might be the most valuable currency of all.</p>
